## Function

The Keypad Spacer is designed to increase the elevation of the a keypad for optimal gameplay, as well as increasing stability during, especially when using on a deskmat. The drafted grip pattern on the bottom surface improves lateral friction on a deskmat, especially when additional weights are used. The cavity accomodates the extra stabilizing weight while reducing print time and material. A symmetrical design mitigates orientation errors during installation while providing leverage during uninstallation.

3. Turn on all supports.
4. No brim or raft needed.

## Instructions
### Postprocessing
